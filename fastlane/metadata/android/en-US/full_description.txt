PeakOrama shows mountains around a location using the PeakFinder-API.
Location can either be searched via the Open-Meteo API or via the GPS of your device.
The view can be rotated manually on the screen, or based on the built-in compass of your device or via direction of movement.
In case your compass has an offset even after calibration there is an option to adjust the offset.
Setting marks is not supported.

A working internet connection is required to use this app.
Approximately 5-10 MB of data is downloaded for each location, so be mindful of your data usage.
